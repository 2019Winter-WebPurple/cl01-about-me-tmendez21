        <h1>All About Tati</h1>
        <hr/ >
        <p>Hello! My name is Tatiana Mendez. I am 16 years old, and my birthday is October 29, 2002. I live in Newark, Delaware with my older brother, my mom, my dad, and my grandparents. I also have a two and a half year-old dobermann named Apollo. My brother, Carlos, is 20 years old, and he is a sophomore at American University in Washington D.C. My dad is away from home for 8 months of the year for his job, so that's why I live with my mom's parents.</p>
        <p>My dad is the chef of the house, so while he is home, I <b>love</b> to help him in the kitchen. However, I also love to cook and bake while he is away. My favorite things to cook are:</p>
        <ul> <!--two unordered lists of my favorite items to cook and bake with links to some recipes for them-->
            <li><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/21659/chicken-quesadillas/">Chicken quesadillas</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.franksredhot.com/recipes/franks-redhot-buffalo-chicken-dip">Buffalo chicken dip</a></li>  
            <li><a href="https://divascancook.com/quick-homemade-pizza-crust-sauce-recipe/">Homemade pizza</a></li>
        </ul>    
        <p>Some of my favorite things to bake are:</p>    
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://tasty.co/recipe/cinnamon-roll-apple-pie">Apple pie</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://preppykitchen.com/moist-vanilla-cupcake-recipe/">Cupcakes</a></li>

        </ul>        
        <p>In my free time, I like to watch movies and TV shows and play with Apollo. My favorite shows to watch are <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> and <i>Brooklyn 99</i>. My favorite movies are any of the Marvel movies, <i>Bad Times at the El Royale,</i> and <i>La La Land.</i> My personal favorite quote is </p><blockquote>The sun will rise and we will try again. </blockquote><p> I feel that it encourages me to keep trying and never give up. </p>
        <p>In elementary and middle school, I used to play softball and volleyball. I played softball from around 2nd grade until 6th grade. Then, in 7th grade, I started to play volleyball. I played volleyball from 7th grade to 9th grade. But now, I row for Newport Rowing Club. This past winter, I decided to try the sport and see if I liked it, and I do! Everyday after school, I have crew practice. I have made so many new friends and I <b>cannot</b> wait for the actual season to start.</p>
